Last year my brother Stephan and I attended the European Lisp
Symposium (ELS) for the first time. It was a great event and therefore
we decided to come to [this year's symposium](http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/2017/index.html). It
took place in Brussels from April 3 to April 4.

After giving a two-days course on IoT using Racket
at [StudiumPlus](http://www.studiumplus.de) last year we submitted a
short demonstration. And: It got accepted! It was a great honor for me
to give a demonstration at the symposium. 

Our paper is in the proceedings which can be found find on
the
[conference's homepage](http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/2017/index.html). The
slides are available there as well. I host
these files here: [Paper](/pub/els2017.pdf)
and [slides](/pub/els2017-slides.pdf).

PS: I am going to add the source code soon to my homepage.
